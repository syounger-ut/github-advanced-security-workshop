# Lab 1: Introduction to Security Remediation
This lab is designed to help you identify security findings and remediate the vulnerabilities in the code using CodeQL and Dependabot. You will use CodeQL to identify security findings in the code and Dependabot to update dependencies and remediate vulnerabilities.

## Security Findings with CodeQL

CodeQL is a powerful, semantic code analysis engine developed by GitHub. It treats code as data, allowing you to query your codebase in the same way you might query a database. CodeQL is particularly effective for identifying security vulnerabilities across many popular coding languages. It allows developers to write queries that find all variants of a vulnerability, and share them with others. CodeQL is used by security researchers to find zero-days and by open source projects and companies to ensure their code is safe and secure.

## Upgrading the vulnerable packages with Dependabot
Dependabot is a tool developed by GitHub that helps to keep your project dependencies up to date. It automatically creates pull requests to update your dependencies to the latest versions. This is particularly useful for addressing security vulnerabilities, as Dependabot can detect when a dependency has a known vulnerability and propose an update to a secure version. It supports a wide range of programming languages and package managers, including but not limited to JavaScript (npm, yarn), Python (pip), Java (Maven), .NET (NuGet), Ruby (Bundler), and more.

### Using CodeQL to identify security findings

You can use CodeQL to identify security findings in the code by running the `codeql database analyze` command. The `codeql database analyze` command will scan the code and display the vulnerabilities found in the code. You can use the vulnerabilities found by CodeQL to identify security issues in the code and remediate the vulnerabilities.

For example, you can use CodeQL to identify security findings such as:
- Open source vulnerabilities
- Code vulnerabilities
- Best practices for securing the code

## Secure Coding with GitHub Copilot
Before you start with the lab, let's go through the commonly asked questions about GitHub Copilot.

- Can GitHub Copilot generate secure code snippets?
- Can GitHub Copilot help in identifying security vulnerabilities in the code?
- Can GitHub Copilot help in fixing security vulnerabilities in the code?
- Can GitHub Copilot help in following secure coding practices?
- Can GitHub Copilot help in following OWASP best practices?

The answer to all these commonly asked questions is YES. GitHub Copilot can generate secure code snippets, identify security vulnerabilities in the code, fix security vulnerabilities in the code, follow secure coding practices, and follow OWASP best practices. GitHub Copilot is designed to help developers write secure code by generating secure code snippets and best practices for securing the code.

But, it's important to note that **Trust but Verify**. While GitHub Copilot can help in generating secure code snippets and best practices, it's important to verify the code snippets and best practices generated by GitHub Copilot to ensure that they meet the security requirements of the application.

This is where the tools like CodeQL and Dependabot come into play. You can use CodeQL to identify security findings in the code and Dependabot to update dependencies and remediate vulnerabilities. By combining CodeQL and Dependabot, you can identify security findings in the code and generate secure code snippets and best practices for remediating the vulnerabilities.

Let's start with the lab and use GitHub Copilot to learn more about the security findings and ask GitHub Copilot to fix the security vulnerabilities in the code.
