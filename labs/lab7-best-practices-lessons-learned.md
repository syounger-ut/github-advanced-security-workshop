# Best practices and lessons learned from GitHub Copilot Workshop

Congratulations on finishing this GitHub Copilot workshop! Hopefully, this workshop session was useful in understanding how GitHub Copilot works in practice when you fix vulnerabilities and implement secure coding practices. In this lab, you will learn about the best practices and lessons learned from the GitHub Copilot workshop.

## What you have learned

Here is a summary of what you have learned:

- **Lab 1: Introduction to Security Remediation** - You learned how to use GitHub Copilot to identify security vulnerabilities and remediate the vulnerabilities in the code
- **Lab 2: Setup and Configuration** - You learned how to set up your development environment with your preferred IDE, GitHub Copilot, Node.js, and GHAS
- **Lab 3: Vulnerable Code setup for security findings** - You learned how to set up the vulnerable code for security findings and test the vulnerabilities in the code
- **Lab 4: Security findings and remediations with GHAS and GitHub Copilot** - You learned how to use GHAS and GitHub Copilot to identify security findings and remediate the vulnerabilities in the code
- **Lab 5: Security Remediation Workflow with GHAS and GitHub Copilot** - You learned how to use GHAS and GitHub Copilot to remediate security vulnerabilities in the code
- **Lab 6: Creating a Pull Request with GitHub Copilot** - You learned how to create a pull request with GitHub Copilot and review the code changes

## Best practices with GitHub Copilot

Although GitHub Copilot keeps getting improved, here are some general suggestions when you with GitHub Copilot, and many of these practices involve the art of mastering **prompt engineering.**

- When you ask GitHub Copilot within the file as comments or function names, try to be detailed as much as possible if you want GitHub Copilot to get it right the first time. You can always override the suggestions given by GitHub Copilot.
- When you ask GitHub Copilot to generate code, always review the code generated by GitHub Copilot to ensure it meets your requirements and standards.
- Don't always 100% trust what GitHub Copilot makes a suggestion to you, and always use your judgement to see what is right or wrong. Again, you are the main developer while your GitHub Copilot is just your assistance pilot.
- **When it comes to security vulnerabilities, Trust but Verify. Always verify the security vulnerabilities and remediations suggested by GitHub Copilot to ensure they are accurate and effective.**
- Always keep your GitHub Copilot extension up-to-date to get the latest features and improvements.
