# Lab 4: Security Remediation Workflow with CodeQL and Dependabot

This lab is designed to help you understand the security remediation workflow with CodeQL and Dependabot. You will learn how to use CodeQL and Dependabot to identify security findings in the code, remediate the vulnerabilities, and secure the code using best practices. No hands-on activities are required for this lab.

## Security Remediation Workflow
The security remediation workflow involves identifying security findings in the code, understanding the vulnerabilities, and remediating the vulnerabilities using secure coding practices. The workflow includes the following steps:
- Identify Security Findings: Use CodeQL and Dependabot to identify security findings in the code.
- Understand the Vulnerabilities: Understand the vulnerabilities and the impact on the application.
- Remediate the Vulnerabilities: Remediate the vulnerabilities using secure coding practices and best practices.
- Secure the Code: Secure the code by implementing security best practices and secure coding practices.
- Perform Code Review: Perform a code review to ensure that the vulnerabilities are remediated and the code is secure.
- Pull Request GitHub Status Checks: Use GitHub status checks to verify the code quality and security before merging the code.

### CodeQL and GitHub Actions Integration
CodeQL can be integrated with GitHub Actions and GitHub repositories to automate the security testing and remediation process. You can use CodeQL GitHub Actions to scan the code for vulnerabilities and security issues.

Integrating CodeQL with GitHub Actions allows you to automate the security testing and remediation process, and ensure that the code is secure before merging the changes to the main branch.

```yaml
name: "CodeQL"
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 23 * * 3'
jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v1
      with:
        languages: "javascript,python"
    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v1
```

### Dependabot Configuration
Dependabot can be configured to automatically check for updates of your dependencies and create pull requests whenever updates are available. This helps to keep your project up-to-date and secure.

To enable Dependabot for your GitHub repository, you need to add a `dependabot.yml` configuration file in the `.github` directory of your repository. Here's an example:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
```

### Recommendation on Faster Remediation
To remediate the vulnerabilities faster, you can use the following recommendations:

- Use CodeQL to identify security findings in the code and provide actionable security alerts.
- Use Dependabot to automatically update your dependencies and fix known vulnerabilities.
- Use GitHub Actions to automate the security testing and remediation process.
- Perform code reviews to ensure that the vulnerabilities are remediated and the code is secure.

The more you actively use these tools while developing the code, the faster you identify and remediate the vulnerabilities - that will lead to secure code.

## Other Security Tools
In addition to CodeQL and Dependabot, there are other security tools and services that can be used to secure applications. Some of the popular security tools and services include:
- GitHub Advanced Security: GitHub Advanced Security provides advanced security features to help you secure your code and applications. It includes features like code scanning, secret scanning, and dependency review.
- GitHub Security Code Scanning: GitHub Security Code Scanning helps you find and fix security vulnerabilities in your code. It scans your code for security vulnerabilities and provides actionable security alerts.
- OWASP Dependency-Check: OWASP Dependency-Check is a software composition analysis tool that scans your project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

## Summary
In this lab, you learned about the security remediation workflow with CodeQL and Dependabot. You also learned about the integration of CodeQL with GitHub Actions and other security tools and services that can be used to secure applications. Performing code reviews and using GitHub status checks are essential steps in the security remediation workflow to ensure that the code is secure before merging the changes to the main branch.

Next, you can proceed to [Lab 6: Best practices and lessons learned](lab6-best-practices-lessons-learned.md) to learn about the best practices and lessons learned from the GitHub Copilot workshop.
