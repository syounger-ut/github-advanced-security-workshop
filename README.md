# GitHub Copilot Advanced Labs - Securing Applications
This repository contains a series of labs demonstrating how to secure applications using GitHub Copilot. The labs are designed to help you learn how to use GitHub Copilot to secure applications by generating secure code snippets and best practices. The labs cover various topics, including OWASP, Secure Coding, and Application Security.

## Objective
The objective of these labs is to help you learn how to use GitHub Copilot to secure applications by generating secure code snippets and best practices. The labs will help you understand how to use GitHub Copilot to generate secure code snippets and best practices for securing applications.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of software development and security concepts
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode) installed on your local machine
- GitHub Copilot extension installed in VSCode
- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine
- CodeQL installed and configured on your local machine

## Self-paced Learning
The labs are designed to be self-paced and can be completed based on your preferred topic and order. You can start with the first lab and proceed to the next labs based on your interest and availability.

## Labs

- [Lab 1: Introduction to Security Remediation](labs/lab1-intro-to-security-remediation)
- [Lab 2: Setup and Configuration](labs/lab2-setup-and-configuration.md)
- [Lab 2b: Initializing your GitHub Repository](labs/lab2b-initializing-your-repository.md)
- [Lab 3: Vulnerable Code Setup for Security Findings](labs/lab3-vulnerable-code-setup.md)
- [Lab 4: Security Findings and Remediationswith CodeQL](labs/lab4-security-findings-remediations.md)
- [Lab 5: Security Findings and Remediations with CodeQL and Dependabot](labs/lab5-security-remediation-workflow.md)
- [Lab 6: Best Practices and Lessons Learned](labs/lab6-best-practices-lessons-learned.md)

## Instructions
The completed files are available in the `completed` directory. You can use the completed files as a reference to complete the labs on your own. You can also use the completed labs to skip ahead and focus on the tasks that you are interested in.
